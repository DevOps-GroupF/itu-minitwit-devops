\subsection{Maintenance}

The first lesson we learned was maintenance of web application requires time and efforts, because there can be many new technologies that programmer has to add or change. 
Another lesson we learned was there exists several tools to performing the same task and choosing which tool could be challenge. 
Ex. Could be for UI testing, Selenium was the first choice, 
but after some research we change and choose Playwright for UI testing because is newer ad maintain by Microsoft.
