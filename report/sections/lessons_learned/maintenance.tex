\subsection{Maintenance}

The first lesson we learned was maintenance of web application requires time and effort, because there can be many new technologies that programmer has to add or change. 
Another lesson we learned was there exists several tools to performing the same task and choosing which tool could be a challenge. 
%After some research, we chose Playwright for UI testing because is newer and maintain by Microsoft.
