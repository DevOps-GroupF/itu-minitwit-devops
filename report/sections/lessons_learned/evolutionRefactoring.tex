\subsection{Evolution and Refactoring}

With regard to evolution and refactoring, we have followed the recommendation to implement the changes in small steps, which made the whole project more manageable. 
Nevertheless, we ran into some issues, especially with our logging. We tried to implement elastic search with Kibana, which worked perfectly on our local machines, 
but deploying it crashed the server due to limited memory. We spent a lot of time on how we could reduce the memory usage so our server keeps up and running 
before we decided to change to Fluentd, which in the end was the better solution. The lesson learned from this is that before implementing a new feature, 
it is good practice to look at all available technologies and compare them to each other, so we end up with the best and easiest solution for our system and save a lot of time.Â
