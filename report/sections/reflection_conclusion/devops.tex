\section{Reflection and conclusion}
\subsection{DevOps approach}
One of the requirements was to make a release every week. This made us work more consistently on our tasks than in other projects before, 
where the working peak was most of the time shortly before the hand-in date. This, we think, simulated the "real working world" way better than the other projects we did before. 
Also, working in a group of five people, delegating our tasks to a Kanban board, coordinating our work, and automating our deployment processes fulfills the devops 
approach of this project.
