\subsubsection{Decision Log}
\paragraph{} Prometheus is a powerful and widely used open-source tool for systems monitoring. We chose this tool for its open-souce nature, ease of use, powerful query language and simple interoperability with Grafana. Prometheus was used as a docker container running on our VMs and it was used for quering monitoring data about our running .NET minitwit application
\paragraph{} Setting up Prometheus really was as easy as just getting a docker image of it running. All the data source configuring was done through Grafana, including all visualization of the data itself.
