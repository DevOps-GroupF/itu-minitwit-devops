\section{Choice of technology}

\subsection{Choice of web framwork}
In our project, we have choosen to work with Microsoft open source web framework .Net, with another opensource database namely Postgres database. Our reason for chosen .Net, was several reason, firs it opensource, so it is very cheap to have in production. Second Microsoft continue to development and main .Net web solution, third it has a huge communicity/documentation, so it easy to get help with any issue. Third it does a lot of work for the developer, so develop a web application in this, is very easy and straight forward. Fourth, .Net use \texttt{C\#} as a language, \texttt{C\#} is general known to be a relative fast and relable langauge which also motivate our choice of choosing Microsoft .Net solution. Lastly Many Medium size/big companies in Denmark are using \texttt{C\#} and .Net technology for their solutions, by using .Net in our project, have given us experience we can use when we graduate.

\subsection{CD/CI reason}
Since we use github for storing our source code, we choose to choice github for CD/CI tool, since these two work very well together.
