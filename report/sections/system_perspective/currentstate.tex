\section{Current state of our application}

We have use Sonarqube and codeclimate to analyze our code base. This section will describe the current state of our application, acording to the two analyze tools.

\subsection*{Codeclimate}

\end{figure}

Codeclimate general reports 323 code smells, and 261 duplications,
but by filtering out included implementations of JavaScript libraries, the real numbers might be reduced significantly.
After the filtering, we found 6 critical issues, which were all related to our usage of JavaScript libraries.
%Mostly of these is from the javascript lib we are using, for some reason even try to filter code, so only \texttt{C\#} code is shown, it still include it. Also it was also possible to filter critical issues, here were 6 found, but related to our used third party javascript library jquery. %So nothing we can do here. 

\subsection*{Sonarqube}
Sunarqube report several issues. Mostly it report security issues, because we are logging to much in our application, which could cause security issues.
