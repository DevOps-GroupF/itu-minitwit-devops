\section*{Introduction}

In this report we present our MiniTwit-project, which was developed during the course *DevOps, Software Evolution and Software Maintenance* at the IT University of Copenhagen.

Our project consists of a software system, namely MiniTwit, and a DevOps system that supports the deployment, operation, development, and maintenance of the software system.
